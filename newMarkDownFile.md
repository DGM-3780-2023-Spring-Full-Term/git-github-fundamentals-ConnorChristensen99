# Connor's Markdown File

### What I learned
> The GitHub Community is very large


> How to create cool looking Readme files with Markdown!


> More overall knowledge reinforcement about the basics of GitHub which is always appreciated

### What I am still confused about
> Branches and Forks. I have not used GitHub collaboratively before so I do not fully understand how that all works, however I am excited to deepen my knowledge on it!
